ActiveRecord TODO
Things left to do:

==================

High Priority
  PostgreSQL
   * Add PostgreSQL support

==================

Low priority:
  Bindings
   * Implement support.
  Inflections
   * Add additonal languages
  Regular Expressions
   * Benchmark AGRegex and replace if necessary
     (I heard it's really really bad, but so far I haven't noticed any problems with it)
  Tiger(and earlier) support
   * Maybe write a version without properties.

==================
     
Suggestions?
